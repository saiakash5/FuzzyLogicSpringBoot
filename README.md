# FuzzyLogicSpringBoot

I have implemented fuuzy logic model using Spring boot. Bascially the code is divided onto various parts and for each part I have implemented an URI where we can check the intermediate results.

You could always change the designed URI's to your choice.

If you any problems understanding contact me.
